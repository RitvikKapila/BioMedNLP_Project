No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. Moderate coronary artery calcification. 2. Multifocal heterogeneously enhancing consolidations in both lower lobes, minimally in the lingula and right middle lobe, likely represent multifocal pneumonia. Prominent septal lines suggest mild pulmonary edema. Centrilobular emphysema. Small prevascular lymphnodes. 3. ETT ends 5 cm above carina. NGT coils in the stomach and courses out of view. Kkaliann. ______________________________________________________________________________ FINAL REPORT HISTORY: 64-year-old with shock, hypoxemia and tachycardia, therefore, question pulmonary embolus. TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet through to the hemidiaphragms. This was initially performed prior to intravenous contrast, followed by contrast infusion with bolus timing to maximize pulmonary arterial enhancement. CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, FINDINGS: There is no evidence of a pulmonary embolus. There is prominence of the pulmonary arteries, raising the question of pulmonary hypertension, however. Additionally, there is enlargement of the right ventricle as well as dilatation of the IVC, all indicative of an element of right heart failure.

Coronal and sagittal reformations are provided. CONTRAST: Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this examination and due to elevated patient creatinine, Visipaque was administered. CTA OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a filling defect within the right lower lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus. No other definite filling defects are identified within the pulmonary arteries. There is no pathologic appearing mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. The central airways appear patent. The ascending aorta is ectatic. There are aortic mural calcifications consistent with atheromatous disease. The heart and pericardium appear unremarkable. There is a small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis. Minimal dependent change within the right upper and right lower lobes. Ill- defined 2 mm nodule within the left base (series 3 image 12). No pneumothorax. Limited images of the upper abdomen demonstrate reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins. There are punctate calcifications within the spleen suggestive of prior granulomatous disease. Note is made of thickening of the left pectoralis muscle and stranding along the pectoralis fascia on the left. There is a suggestion of soft tissue stranding about the left shoulder. Evaluation is limited by the presence of streak artifact arising from the left humeral prosthesis. BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

PFTs [**4-/2112**]: Reduced FVC (72%) and Dsb (63%) with low-normal TLC suggests a restrictive process. . Echo [**3-/2112**]: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The LV cavity size is normal. Regional LV wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF> 55%). Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal LV filling pressure. 3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. RV systolic function is normal. 4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. 6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated because of the lack of a tricusped regurgitation jet. 7.There is no pericardial effusion. Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo F with multiple myeloma on Thalidomide and Decadron who presents with progressive DOE x 6 weeks, hypoxia, hypotension, and ARF. The following issues were investigated during her hospitalization: 1) Resp Distress: On presentation to the CCU, the patient still was still hypoxic to 80s on room air, requiring 60% face mask. Her physical exam was unremarkable for CHF - she had no peripheral edema, no JVD and her lungs were clear bilaterally. Given her hypoxia, elevated A-a gradient (297), history of multiple myeloma and her treatment with Thalidomide and Decadron (known to be thrombogenic and pt. was not on outpatient anticoagulation), there was significant concern for a PE. Her Thalidomide was discontinued and she was started on a Heparin drip. Her elevated creatinine did not allow for a CTA so a VQ scan was performed and was highly suspcious for a PE with multiple perfusion deficits. Additionally, an echo showed depressed RV function and evidence of RV hypertrophy and LE dopplers showed a DVT in her right popliteal artery. The evidence of RV hypertrophy and multiple VQ mismatches suggested an acute and chronic thromboembolic disease. The Heparin drip was continued and she was started on Coumadin. As she rapidly improved she was not thought to be a candidate for thrombolytics. Her aPTT goal was 60-80 while she was transitioned to Coumadin. Upon arrival to the BMT service, her hypoxia continued to improve. By time of discharge, she maintained normal oxygen saturation on room air. As the patient had transient risk factors for DVT/PE (i.e. recent long car ride and thalidomide), will anticipate ~6 months of anticoagulation with INR [**3-4**]. . 2.) CARDIAC: * Ischemia: On admission to the ED, the patient had CE drawn to r/o an MI. CK = 89 and Trop = 0.07. There is no reported history of CAD and no EKG changes, but the patient has hyperlipidemia, HTN, and hyperglycemia. She was continued on ASA 81 mg. Metoprolol 12.5 was added once her BP could tolerate it. A statin should perhaps be considered given an LDL in [**March 2112**] of 131; this can be revisited as an outpatient. . * Pump: Pt's pro-BNP on admission was 4948. She also has a history of chronic LE edema for which she takes Lasix and Triamterine as an outpatient. However, on exam her lung exam was unremarkable and she had no peripheral edema. Her CXR was also unremarkable. Given her ARF, her diuretics were held. On transfer to BMT, she was restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix since she had some trace LE edema and b/l pulmonary crackles. Her Ace-inhibitor was still held because of her resolving ARF. By time of discharge, her renal impairment had resolved to baseline and she will resume her home dose of ACEi. * Hypotension: Likely due to PEs. She was initially treated empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn for concern of sepsis given the high lactate. Her lactate decreased to 1.1 on repeat ABG. She was never febrile and her vitals stabilized so the antibiotics were d/c'd on day 2 of hospitalization. Blood and urine cultures are still pending, but show no growth. Her BP meds (Diltiazem and Lisinopril) were held, but a Metoprolol 12.5 was started on [**10-5**] because her blood pressure had improved and because of her cardiac risk factors. . 3 Leukocytosis: Pt's WBC trended down. There was no bandemia and no signs of infection. Etiology is unclear, but patient did recently complete a recurring treatment of Decadron. . 4 Acute Renal Failure: Admission Cr was 3.4 and her baseline Cr is 1.1. All diuretics were held as was Metformin for concern of lactic acidosis in the setting of ARF. Her creatinine trended downward for the remainder of her hospitalization. By time of discharge, her Cr resolved to normal. 5 Hyperglycemia: Secondary to decadron. Outpatient Metformin was held because of ARF. FS were done QID with humalog/SSI until all blood sugars were normal. She did not require insulin while on the medical floor. . 6 Multiple Myeloma: Hem/Onc fellow was notified that the patient had been admitted and the decision was made to hold Thalidomide for now. Pt. was transferred to BMT service on [**10-5**]. She will follow-up with her primary hematologist after discharge. . 7 Anemia: Baseline Hct is in the 30s, on iron as an outpatient. Pt. received 1 [**Location **] on [**10-4**] for Hct of 28.5 which appropriately responded to 30.1. . 8 Prophylaxis: PPI (on steroids), heparin gtt, bowel regimen. . 9 FEN: low Na diabetic renal diet. check albumin . 10 Access: PIVs x 2 . 11 Code Status: Full, discussed with pt and family Medications on Admission: Triamterene/HCTZ 37.5/25 mg po daily Aspirin 81 mg PO daily Lasix 40 mg PO Lisinopril 20 mg PO daily Diltiazem XR 480 mg PO Metformin 850 mg PO BID Prilosec 40 QD Thalidomide 100 mg PO QHS Dexamethasone pulse Q2 weeks Epogen 40,000 units zometa Qmonth T#3 1-2 tabs prn TID Diprosone 0.05% cream Discharge Medications: 1.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Needs IVC filter FINAL REPORT INDICATION: A 57-year-old with left superficial femoral vein DVT and large saddle pulmonary embolus. IVC filter is requested for prophylaxis of further pulmonary emboli. PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 48843**] [**Name (STitle) 48844**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 34428**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising during the entire procedure. PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: Signed written informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure. In addition, a pre-procedure time-out was performed prior to the procedure confirming patient identity, the procedure to be performed, and the side and site of entry. Approximately 5 cc of 1% Lidocaine was injected into the right groin for local anesthesia. The right common femoral vein was visualized using both ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic guidance. The common femoral vein was then accessed using a 19-gauge micro-puncture needle through which a Glide-wire was then passed into the inferior vena cava. The micro-puncture needle was removed and a 4-French Omni-Flush catheter was then advanced over the guide wire to the level of the distal inferior vena cava just proximal to the iliac bifurcation. An inferior vena cavogram was then performed. The inferior vena cavogram demonstrated a patent inferior vena cava and patent bilateral common iliac veins. Reflux of contrast was seen into the right and left iliac veins consistent with elevated right atrial pressures. A suitable position for filter placement was then selected with the tip of the filter at the margin of the inferior endplate of the L1 vertebral body, below the inflow of the renal veins. The glide wire was removed and a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 52**] guide wire was advanced through the catheter. The catheter was then exchanged for a 7-French Bard recovery filter system. The guide wire was removed. The recovery filter was then deployed successfully into the designated area using fluoroscopic guidance.
